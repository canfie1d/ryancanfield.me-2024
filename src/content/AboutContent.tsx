      <h2>the site</h2>
      <p className={styles.p}>
        After reviewing the site analytics of my previous website iterations, I
        noticed that many users only visited one time. That result aligned with
        my general assumption that portfolio sites don't have frequent
        non-unique visitors, but I thought that there must be a way to improve
        that statistic for myself and my site.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.p}>
        I began by thinking of the type of users that might be visiting my
        websiteâ€” developers, engineering managers, tech recruiters, and
        designers. I decided that because developers &amp; designers had the
        least to gain from interacting with and revisiting my site, adding some
        tooling for them would create value for them (you) to come back.

          <h3>theming</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            This site includes a theming feature that enables the ability to
            switch between premade themes or create fully custom themes that can
            easily be applied to other projects. The feature is built directly
            into the fabric of the website enabling it to be utilized in two
            completely separate ways.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            To assist with theme generation, I've included an API from{" "}
            <a href="colormind.io" target="_blank">
              colormind.io
            </a>
            . This API generates color palettes based on provided colors or, if
            none are provided, at random.

        <li>
          <h3>motion</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            I have utilized Framer Motion, a powerful animation library for
            React, to add smooth and engaging animations throughout the site,
            creating a more interactive and engaging experience (I mean, how
            satisfying is that scroll animation?).
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            And of course, for users that have a preference for reduced motion,
            those animations are completely muted.

            reflects the entire spectum of modern JavaScript features from the
            latest React hooks (and some custom ones), latest CSS selectors and
