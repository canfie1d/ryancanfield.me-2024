Even then, the agreement only provides necessary documents. Updates and changes still need to be managed with additional emails or phone calls. Once the agreement is in place, there is little information available to brokerages about the driver moving it, whether or not they are running on time, and the shipments exact location.",

In order to achieve this, we would need a solution that opened up the line of communication for everyone involved.",

The auctions are immediately available to all carriers through a public load board. The load is also passed through the matching algorithm and matches can be invited to place a bid. Once an auction closes, the load is converted to a shipment which receives up to the minute updates on status and driver location.",
